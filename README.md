PeakRoute is a tool that can be used to streamline the process of taking the bus to class in the morning for students in London, ON attending either Western University or Fanshawe College. It uses a SenseCAP Indicator D1 to show the bus times that will get you to campus on time, eliminating the need to input your desired destination and time of arrival everyday. It is based on the idea that students have the same weekly schedule, so the times they need to reach campus are consistent. However, bus times can be unpredictable, which is why this display should be used to help find bus times in a glance.
